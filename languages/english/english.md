## Most beautiful English word
Remember how J.R.R. Tolkien said the following:  
> Most English-speaking people … will admit that 'cellar door' is beautiful, especially if dissociated from its sense and from its spelling. More beautiful than, say, 'sky', and far more beautiful than 'beautiful' … Well then, in Welsh, for me cellar doors are extraordinarily frequent  

*Cellar door* is indeed a beautiful word.  
However my contender for most beautiful English word is **aviary**.
> a large cage, building, or enclosure for keeping birds in
