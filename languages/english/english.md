## Notes
My favorite language. The amazing thing about English is how versatile it is. There seems to exist a word for everything.  

> English is the largest language by number of speakers, and the third most-spoken native language in the world, after Standard Chinese and Spanish. There are more people who have learned it as a second language than there are native speakers. It is estimated that there are over 2 billion speakers of English.
