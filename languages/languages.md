Languages are cool.  
Random sounds when combined convey meaning to someone who knows that language.

## Frequency Lists
When learning a language, a good strategy is to learn the most frequently used words in that language first.  
Thankfully, Wiktionary has a list with links to get the most frequently used words in a lot of languages.
