## Consonants
- 35 consonant characters, although 2 are obsolete (see below)
- Each consonant has an *inherent vowel*, *â* or *ô*
- Each consonant can belong to one of two *series*, the *a*-series or *o*-series
- Each consonant, expect one, also has a subscript form
  - May also be called *sub-consonants*
    - ជើងអក្សរ in Khmer (*cheung âksâr*)
  - Most subscript consonants resemble their corresponding consonant symbol, but sometimes there's no obvious resemblance
  - Most subscript consonants are written directly below other consonants, although subscript *r* is written to the left, and others have ascending elements that appear to the right
