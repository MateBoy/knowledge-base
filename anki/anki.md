# Anki
Anki is a flashcard app that uses spaced repetition to make learning pretty much anything more effective.
Basically, you add a bunch of flashcards about stuff you want to remember / learn into what Anki calls a *deck*, and then you review these cards regularly.

## Flashcards
So, what is a flashcard? I'll provide a very basic example.  
Say you're trying to learn Swedish (spaced repetition is very effective for learning languages), and want to remember the word for *future* (*framtid* in Swedish).  
An Anki flashcard will in this example display the word *future*. Now it's up to you to try to remember what this word means.  
After thinking about it, touch the screen (or click the screen, whatever). Anki will now display the correct answer, *framtid*.  
Here's where the magic happens: you now have to tell Anki how difficult this flashcard was for you.
- Was it very easy?
- Was it moderately easy?
- Was it difficult?
- Did you not remember at all?  

Based on what you chose, Anki will schedule this card again at an appropriate time. If you failed the card, you'll see it again before the end of your current review session.  

Ideally, a review session should be done every day.
