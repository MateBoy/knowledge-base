# Front End
> Front-end web development is the practice of converting data to a graphical interface, through the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so that users can view and interact with that data.

## Tools used in front end development
### HTML
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a website described through text, so that the web browser knows what to display. You can think of it as the *skeleton* of a web page.

### CSS
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) describes how a website should look. These presentational *styles* are written in **style sheets**, and the cascading part refers to how one part of a page can inherit CSS styles from several sources, and in effect *cascade* on top of each other.

### JavaScript
JavaScript (which has no relation to Java) is used to make static HTML pages more dynamic by allowing the developer to add interactivity.
