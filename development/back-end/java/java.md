> Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented, and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.

## Notes
I'm currently trying to broaden my horizons by learning more back end oriented programming languages, with Java being the first step.
