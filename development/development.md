As a web developer I constantly have to do context switching between different programming languages.  
I consider myself adept at the three staples of front end: HTML, CSS & JavaScript.  
I am currently trying to learn more general-purpose programming as well, mainly focusing on Java and Swift.

## Programming Languages And Frameworks I'm Interested In
- [Git](git/git.md)
- [Java](java/java.md)
- [JavaScript](javascript/javascript.md)
- [Swift](swift/swift.md)
- [Vue.js](vue/vue.md)
