As a web developer I constantly have to do context switching between different programming languages.  
I consider myself adept at the three staples of front end: HTML, CSS & JavaScript.  
I am currently trying to learn more back end as well, mainly focusing on Java.

## Back End
- [Back End](back-end/back-end/back-end.md)
    - [Java](back-end/java/java.md)

## Front End
- [Front End](front-end/front-end.md)
    - [Git](front-end/git/git.md)
    - [JavaScript](front-end/javascript/javascript.md)
    - [Vue.js](front-end/vue/vue.md)
