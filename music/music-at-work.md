## Listening to music at work
Since I work in an office, I also listen to a lot of music during work hours. What kind of music it is depends on how hard I need to focus.

Generally, if less intense focus is needed, pretty much anything is okay, even music with vocals.

However, if more focus is needed, there are certain genres I prefer.

## Music for focusing
Needing to focus on a task for long periods at a time eliminates music with vocals since I end up focusing on what is being sung rather than on what I should be working on.

Here are some genres and examples of artists / bands that are more apt for deep work (links go to artist on Spotify):
