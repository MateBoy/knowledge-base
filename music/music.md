# Music
I've had an addiction to finding and listening to music for well over 10 years now.  
I both enjoy listenting to old favorites and get giddy discovering new excellent acts.  
I mostly listen on Spotify, but sometimes I'll also use YouTube or SoundCloud.

## Last.fm
I use Last.fm to track my listening habits and history. I have data from ~2009 or so.  
As of writing this I have about 102000 scrobbles logged.  
My top artists are:
- Fleet Foxes
- The Beatles
- Animal Collective
- Tycho
- Aphex Twin
- Panda Bear
- Belle & Sebastian
- Deerhunter
