# Knowledge Base
Hi there! ðŸ‘‹  
My name is Mathias and this wiki is an ongoing database of knowledge I both want to share and want to remember and document for myself.

It was inspired by Nikitia Voloboev's amazing [Everything I Know](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/).

You can also find a list with a lot of similar projects [here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/meta-knowledge#readme).

## How
All of the content here is written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files on a [GitBook](https://gitbook.com) hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com).  
You can find the repository for this knowledge base [here](https://github.com/MateBoy/knowledge-base).
